Big thanks to TheNunnceler for maintaining the mod, while I currently can't do the job

[h1] MOD CONCEPT [/h1]
- The mod is meant to improve the map's de jure structure and add baronies, provinces and cultures. Where possible in the Middle East, Europe and Africa.
- Unlike many modders I don't inherently imply that the vanilla map is wrong, inaccurate etc. at least not in the areas I am most interested about, which is roughly the areas travelled by Ibn Battuta. I do respect the great effort the developers have done. Partly because I know that they invested a lot of effort and resources into this and I made my best to help them with it. Yet some of the choices could be made differently and this mod is a platform for my alternative designs to the vanilla map.

- I respect the development team's design choices as well as basic principles which were behind them as far as I have learned about them.
- I also want to keep this mod minimalistic and relatively close to vanilla if possible, just like I did in the previous iteration of this mod
- Yet I see there is still quite a lot of room for improvement of the map.
- For the sake of compatibility with other mods, this will be solely map mod dealing with map, de jure structure and with very tiny changes in cultures map. Like in CK2 I plan to build an upgrade of this mod "Ibn Battuta's World", which will also edit some titular history and potentially also change other gameplay features on the top of this mod.

[h1] MOD OBJECTIVES [/h1] (what to expect and what [b]not to expect [/b])​
- From the above said it should be clear that this mod doesn't plan to repaint the map's projection, nor to remove the content already present there, although I do agree with other map modders that some of it shouldn't be there if we want some consistency.
- The mod also doesn't plan adding hundreds of baronies or even counties, completely overhaul the de-jure structure
- What you can expect however is small changes here and there to improve the accuracy, yet remain close to the game's basic design.
- I plan to add also several cultures, but since I'm not a fan of micro-cultures for every duchy or every 2 counties, don't expect me to flood the map with them, although they historically existed. From gameplay perspective (after the game is unpaused) they way too often decrease the general accuracy instead of increasing it. Quite frankly I would myself even get rid of several vanilla cultures which are IMHO way too small. But as I said, I don't intend to remove any content.
- Also I don't plan nor intend to use localized names for kingdoms into their local languages. This game is in English and hence the names will be in English and in the forms used by modern historiography. Even the ones which are recently contested.
