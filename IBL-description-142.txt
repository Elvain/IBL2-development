[h1] MOD CONCEPT [/h1]
- The mod is meant to improve the map's de jure structure and add baronies, provinces and cultures. Where possible in the Middle East, Europe and Africa.
- While I want to add detail and accuracy where possible, I don't inherently consider vanilla map wrong
- in order to keep the game playable, I respect vanilla basic design in terms of minimal province size.
- I also want to keep this mod minimalistic and relatively close to vanilla if possible, just like I did in the previous iteration of this mod
- For the sake of compatibility with other mods, this will be solely map mod dealing with map, de jure structure and with very tiny changes in cultures map. Like in CK2 I plan to build an upgrade of this mod "Ibn Battuta's World", which will also edit some titular history and potentially also change other gameplay features on the top of this mod.

[h1] MOD OBJECTIVES [/h1] (what to expect and what [b]not to expect [/b])​
- This mod doesn't make a complete overhaul of map and its projection
- New cultures are added only in cases where previously some vanilla cultures stretches hundreds of kilometers into areas where it never was
- I don't plan nor intend to use localized names for kingdoms into their local languages. This game is in English and hence the names will be in English and in the forms used by modern historiography. Even the ones which are recently contested.

[h1] COMPATIBILITY: [/h1]
- Does not work with achievements! Many changes to the checksum.
- Should work ok with most mods, unles the other mods change the map or its structure.
- after 1.5.0 some compatches may not work propperly yet, or at all, be careful
